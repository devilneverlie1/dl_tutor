# CS 190 - Deep Learning for Medical Imaging

## Overview

The “Introduction to Deep Learning for Medical Imaging” course is aimed to provide the skillset needed to design, train and validate convolutional neural networks for various imaging applications in the healthcare setting. A primary focus will be placed on the practical aspects of algorithm creation, including use of the Tensorflow 2.0 / Keras library to train networks using real-life datasets including those from the UCI Medical Center. The course curriculum is comprised of a combination of didactic lectures and live Python coding sessions, as well several special guest lectures from physicians and healthcare practitioners. Homework assignments as well as midterm and final projects will involve submission of Python source code and trained network models.

All software used in this coursework is open-source and free of charge. Assignments and projects can be completed online using GPU-enabled instances in the web-based Google Colaboratory platform, as well as using hardware infrastructure available at the UCI Center of AI in Diagnostic Medicine (CAIDM). As requested, instructions will be provided for local installation of the Python environment and dependencies for students with access to a personal GPU. Live in-class Python coding sessions will be led by the instructor in Jupyter notebooks hosted on the Google Colaboratory platform; please bring your personal laptop computer to follow along.
